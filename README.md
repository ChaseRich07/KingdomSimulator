# KingdomSimulator

I originally intended for this game to be much more in depth, but I fell in love with another project idea that I am now working on. That means that while this is technically a fully fledged simulator, there are redundancies in the code, unused lines, and some in game events that don't actually do anything. I intend to eventually come back and finish this though.

The 3 mechanics that control the game are 'Riches', 'Productivity', and 'Population'. When any of these either fail, or become too big to fail, the game ends.

The real driver of the game is the plague/infection, which forces the player to manage all 3 of the above mechanics very carefully.

Originally, the game was much less forgiving, but I made some changes before creating this repository since I wanted the average player to be able to experience the whole thing.
